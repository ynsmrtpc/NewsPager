<p>Note: Since the "node_modules" folder is too large, I deleted the folder. You can have all necessary packages installed by typing 'npm install'* or 'yarn install'** in the terminal. </p>

<p> *  You need to have npm installed on your computer. </p>
<p> ** You need to have yarn installed on your computer. </p>
